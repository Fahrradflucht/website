<p class="lead">Install packages globally on your operating system.</p>

##### `yarn global` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-global" href="#toc-yarn-global"></a>

`yarn global` is a prefix used for a number of commands like `add`, `bin`, `ls` and `remove`. They behave identically to their normal versions except that they use a global directory to store packages.

To make the binaries globally available on your operating system you have to add the path returned by `yarn global bin` to your operation systems `$PATH` variable. Note that the path will change on every node version upgrade.

This is useful for developer tooling that is not part of any individual project but instead is used for local commands. One such example is [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) which can be installed globally like this:

```sh
$ yarn global add create-react-app
# the `create-react-app` command is now available globally:
$ create-react-app
````

Read more about the commands that can be used together with `yarn global`:

- [`yarn add`](./add): add a package to use in your current package.
- [`yarn bin`](./bin): displays the location of the yarn bin folder.
- [`yarn ls`](./ls): list installed packages.
- [`yarn remove`](./remove): remove a package that will no longer be used in your current package.
